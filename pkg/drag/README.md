# drag

Aerodynamic drag modeling system that calculates drag forces on rockets during flight.

## Notes
- Implements different drag coefficient calculation methods
- Accounts for varying Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers
- Supports component-based drag calculation for complex geometries
- Handles both subsonic and supersonic flight regimes
- Provides accurate drag prediction based on atmospheric conditions
- Calculates area-based drag for different rocket components
- Considers surface roughness effects on boundary layer behavior
- Enables pressure and skin friction drag component analysis
