# pkg/drag

This package provides functionality for calculating the drag force on a rocket.

## Responsibility

*   Calculate the drag force on a rocket.
*   Account for different drag coefficients based on the rocket's shape and velocity.
*   Consider the effects of air density and viscosity.

## Scope

*   Support different drag models, such as the Newtonian drag model and the semi-empirical drag model.
*   Provide options for customizing the drag calculation process.

## Gotchas

*   Accuracy of the drag coefficient data.
*   Complexity of the drag models.

## Test Suite Overview

The test suite includes unit tests for the core functionality of the package, including:

*   Calculating the drag force on a rocket.
*   Accounting for different drag coefficients.
*   Considering the effects of air density and viscosity.
