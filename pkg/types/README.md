# types

Fundamental data types and mathematical structures for representing physical quantities in the simulation.

## Notes
- Implements core mathematical types such as Vector3, Quaternion, and Matrix3x3
- Provides physical state representations (Position, Velocity, Acceleration)
- Defines specialized types for mass, orientation, and other physical properties
- Includes methods for vector operations and coordinate transformations
- Implements quaternion-based rotation calculations for 3D space
- Supports serialization of types for storage and communication
- Ensures type safety and consistent units across the simulation
- Provides utility functions for common mathematical operations
