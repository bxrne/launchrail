# components

Physical rocket components library that provides models for various rocket parts with accurate physics properties.

## Notes
- Implements component models for nosecones, bodytube, motors, parachutes
- Calculates mass, inertia, and center of gravity properties
- Provides geometric representation of physical rocket parts
- Supports different nose cone profiles (ogive, conical, etc.)
- Models motor thrust curves and propellant consumption over time
- Implements parachute deployment and drag characteristics
- Follows entity-component system (ECS) architecture for modularity
- Includes precise physical properties required for accurate simulation
