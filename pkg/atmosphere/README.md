# atmosphere

Atmospheric modeling library that provides standard atmospheric data and calculations for rocket simulations.

## Notes
- Implements the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model
- Calculates air density, pressure, and temperature at different altitudes
- Supports customization of atmospheric parameters
- Provides methods for atmospheric property interpolation
- Handles different units and coordinate systems
- Enables altitude-based calculations for aerodynamic forces
- Includes temperature and pressure gradients for realistic modeling
- Supports both standard and non-standard atmospheric conditions
