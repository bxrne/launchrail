# thrustcurves

Motor thrust curve implementation that provides accurate thrust modeling for rocket motor simulation.

## Notes
- Manages motor thrust curves from standardized data files
- Implements interpolation for precise thrust values at any time point
- Calculates motor impulse and performance characteristics
- Supports various motor types and configurations
- Handles propellant mass consumption modeling during burns
- Provides motor classification based on total impulse
- Integrates with component system for realistic motor behavior
- Enables custom thrust curve definition for specialized motors
