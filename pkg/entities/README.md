# entities

Entity definitions and management system for rocket simulation using the entity-component architecture.

## Notes
- Implements core entity definitions (rockets, launch pads, etc.)
- Aggregates components to build complete functional entities
- Provides entity creation and initialization methods
- Manages entity lifecycle through simulation phases
- Calculates complex entity properties based on component data
- Maintains physical properties like mass, center of gravity
- Ensures proper component relationships and dependencies
- Supports runtime querying and modification of entity attributes
