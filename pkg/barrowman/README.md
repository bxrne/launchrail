# barrowman

Implementation of the Barrowman method for calculating rocket stability and aerodynamic properties.

## Notes
- Calculates center of pressure (CP) for rocket configurations
- Implements stability analysis based on CP and center of gravity
- Accounts for fin, nose cone, and body tube geometries
- Provides stability margin calculations for flight safety analysis
- Handles both subsonic and transonic aerodynamic calculations
- Includes corrections for different rocket configurations
- Supports variable angle of attack calculations
- Integrates with component models for comprehensive stability analysis
