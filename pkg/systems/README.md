# systems

Collection of physics-based systems that implement specialized simulation behaviors using the entity-component architecture.

## Notes
- Implements different physical systems for rocket simulation (physics, aerodynamics, launch rail)
- Follows entity-component system (ECS) principles for modular design
- Handles forces calculation and motion updates for simulation entities
- Defines constraints and rules for entity interactions
- Manages simulation state transitions during flight phases
- Includes parallel processing capabilities for performance optimization
- Provides clean interfaces for integration with the core simulation loop
- Implements specialized mathematics for aerospace applications
