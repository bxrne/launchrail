# weather

Weather data client that fetches and processes atmospheric conditions for rocket launch simulations.

## Notes
- Retrieves real-time or historical weather data from external sources
- Implements data models for atmospheric parameters (wind, pressure, temperature)
- Converts raw weather data into simulation-compatible formats
- Provides caching mechanisms for efficient data access
- Handles API integration with weather service providers
- Includes fallback mechanisms for when external services are unavailable
- Supports different altitude levels for vertical weather profiles
- Implements proper error handling for network and data parsing issues
