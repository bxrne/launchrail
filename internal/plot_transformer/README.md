# plot_transformer

Data transformation utility for converting simulation data into formats suitable for visualization and plotting.

## Notes
- Transforms raw simulation data into plottable formats
- Provides coordinate system transformations when needed
- Handles data type conversions (e.g., string to float64)
- Supports various plotting libraries and output formats
- Implements data filtering and aggregation methods
- Optimizes large datasets for visualization performance
- Ensures consistent scaling and units across plot types
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing visualization systems
