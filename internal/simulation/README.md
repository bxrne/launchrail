## internal/simulation

### Responsibility
- Implements the core simulation logic.
- Manages the simulation loop and updates the simulation state.

### Scope
- Simulation loop implementation.
- State update logic.
- Physics calculations.

### Test Suite Overview
- Tests should cover the simulation loop, state updates, and physics calculations.

### Decisions & Potential Gotchas
- Physics calculations may need to be optimized for performance.
- State update logic should be well-defined and documented.
