# storage

Persistent data storage system that manages simulation records, events, and motion data.

## Notes
- Handles creation, reading, and management of simulation data records
- Implements efficient file-based storage with appropriate schemas
- Provides record tracking with deterministic hashing for reproducibility
- Supports multiple data formats including motion, events, and dynamics
- Includes interfaces for consistent data access across the application
- Contains error handling for storage operations
- Uses structured file layout for organizing simulation results
- Supports efficient querying and filtering of stored records
