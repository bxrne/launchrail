# internal/http_client

## Description

The `internal/http_client` package provides a customized HTTP client for making external HTTP requests. It likely wraps the standard Go `net/http` client to offer enhanced functionalities such as custom configurations, retry mechanisms, and standardized error handling, making outbound API calls more robust and manageable.

### Key Components

* **HTTP Client Implementation (`client.go`):**
  * Contains the core logic for the custom HTTP client.
  * Likely defines a struct that wraps or extends `http.Client`.
  * Provides methods for common HTTP operations (e.g., GET, POST) with added features like request/response logging, timeout settings, and potentially retry logic.
  * Handles the construction of HTTP requests and parsing of responses.

* **Mock HTTP Client (`mock_client.go`):**
  * Provides a mock implementation of the HTTP client or its interface.
  * Essential for unit testing other packages that depend on this client, allowing tests to simulate various HTTP responses (success, failures, specific data) without making actual network calls.

* **Tests (`client_test.go`, `mock_client_test.go`):**
  * `client_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the actual HTTP client implementation, verifying its request execution, response handling, error conditions, and any special features like retry logic.
  * `mock_client_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the mock client itself or examples of how to use the mock client in tests.

### Core Functionalities

* **Configurable HTTP Requests:** Allows for setting custom headers, timeouts, and other request parameters.
* **Resilient Communication:** May implement retry logic for transient network errors or specific HTTP status codes.
* **Standardized Error Handling:** Provides a consistent way of handling errors from HTTP requests.
* **Testability:** Offers a mock client to facilitate isolated unit testing of dependent components.

### Technical Details

* **Base:** Built upon Go's standard `net/http` package.
* **Testing:** Utilizes mock implementations for robust unit testing.
